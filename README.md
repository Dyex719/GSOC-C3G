## Next Task
Try to implement heterozygosity in the Wright-Fischer Model. 
Heteroyzgosity can be thought of as the (expected) probability that an individual will be heterozygous at a given locus and tells us about the structure and history of the population. In population genetics, it gives us an idea of how long fixation takes to occur.
